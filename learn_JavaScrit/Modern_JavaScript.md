# Modern JavaScript Mainly for React js #


**JavaScript/EcmaScript 2015(ES6) is keep updating these days, So i will write about ES6 and mai focus is to use Reactjs framework. I have summarised what I see as the major new features released in each ECMA Script version.**

## Versions of JavaScript
---------------------------------------------------

**ES5 (2009)**

* This is the baseline version of JS which you can generally assume all run-times (except really old ones!) will support.

**ES6 / ES2015**

* Standard Modules `import` and `exort`
* Standardised Promises
* Classes & Inheritance
* Block-scoped variables -- `let` and `const`
* Template Literals
* Object destructing into variables
* Generator functions
* Map and Set data structures
* Internationalisation for Strings, Numbers and Dates via `Intl` API

**ES7 / ES2016**

* `Array.includes()`
* Numeric exponent (power of) operator `**`

**ES8 / ES2017**

* Async functions
* Object.entries
* String Padding functions

**ES9 / ES2018**

* Object Rest/Spread `const obj = { ...props };`
* Asynchronous Iteration `for await (...) {`
* Promise `finally()` function
* Regular expression enhancements (lookbehind, named groups)

Some of the features of ES6:

* Variable Creation using `let` and `const`

* Arrow functions
* Rest and Sread Operator
* DeStructuring
* Array functions `find()` and `findIndex()`

**Babel is a PreProcessor of JavaScript/EcmaScript. it is mainly used to convert ES6+ code into a backwards compatible version of javascript that can be run by older browsers.**
